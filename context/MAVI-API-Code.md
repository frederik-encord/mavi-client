Here are some common response code that developers may encounter when using the MAVI-API.

## Response code​

## VideoStatus enum​

The VideoStatus enum has three states: PARSE, UNPARSE and PARSE_ERROR, representing success, pending, and failure, respectively. Failure to upload a video is very unlikely. If unfortunately, an PARSE_ERROR occurs, please examine the video encoding format with our provided failure information in the API response. If the issue cannot be resolved, please contact us. We will always be there to improve our platform's developing experience.
